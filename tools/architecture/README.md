# Architecture scanner

Run from the repository root:

```bash
node tools/architecture/scan-architecture.mjs --check
node tools/architecture/scan-architecture.mjs --report
```

`--check` enforces:

- exactly 12 registered contexts;
- no unclassified production source roots;
- no new direct cross-context dependency pair;
- no increase in a recorded direct-import allowance;
- browser/server direct `fetch` only at canonical transports or explicitly
  recorded raw/protocol exceptions, with stale allowances rejected;
- one App Router `/api/v1` JSON BFF instead of a duplicate Next rewrite;
- server-only Web API upstream configuration (`API_UPSTREAM`);
- `@shared/foundation` registered as the `architecture-foundation` public package,
  while architecture-foundation itself cannot depend on business public surfaces;
- StableId foundation primitives have exactly one implementation owner and are not
  re-exported from Menu/Order business packages;
- Brand/Store canonical configuration and configured stable store identity have
  one registered public surface and Prisma reader implementation; `apps/api/src/store`
  cannot regress to legacy `BusinessConfig`, the deleted `common/store-id.ts`
  path cannot return, configured store identity has one implementation owner,
  and cross-context consumers cannot deep-import the Prisma reader instead of
  `store/public-api.ts`;
- unique, complete compatibility entries;
- no unregistered `@compat <compat_id>` annotation.

Imports through `public-api`, `contracts`, `ports`, and registered public
shared-package aliases are reported but do not consume legacy debt allowances.
When a PR removes direct imports, lower the matching value in
`context-baseline.json` in the same PR. Never raise a limit merely to make CI
green; either use a public contract/port or update the architecture decision and
compatibility plan explicitly.
